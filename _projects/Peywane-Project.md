description: "This is a personal Unity project and is still on going. By working on the vocabulary of the Kurdish dictionary (Xal) and by morphological analysis and using Python and postgreSQL, I (somewhat) succeeded in extracting the (noun) words from this dictionary. Then by obtaining all permutations of 3 to 8 letters of the Kurdish alphabet, in each permutation, I categorized the words related to that permutation in a concept called (Level)."
